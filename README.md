Advancing Skills and Careers through Economic Networks and Tools
Project Need: Corporate downsizing and industry restructuring have stressed the ability of Delawareans
to navigate to and through the middle class. The transformation of Delaware's economic landscape has
been stark.1 In 1992, Delaware ranked 50th relative to the share of workers employed by firms less than 5
years oldâ€”by 2020 Delaware ranked 1st. While many Delawareans have prospered during this
transformative period, others in persistently distressed communities have been unable to participate and
advance in a more dynamic economy. Delaware's labor force participation rate has fallen from nearly 70
percent (17th) in 1992 to 61 percent (31st) in 2020.
Proposal: The Delaware Workforce Development Board (DWDB) seeks EDA Recompete Pilot program
funds to advance the Delaware ASCENT initiative and address persistent economic mobility and security
challenges in distressed, New Castle County communities. The ASCENT pilot aims to 1) help individuals
and community organizations identify barriers to workforce participation and advancement; 2) design and
pilot "benefits backstop" programs to alleviate barriers related to childcare, housing, transportation, and
training needs; and 3) ensure transitions into promising careers by focusing program design and
placement efforts on existing and emerging industries that leverage regional assets and partnerships.
DWDB and its partners will use the Atlanta Federal Reserve's Career Ladder Identifier and Financial
Forecaster (CLIFF) tool to help individuals understand the complexity of their benefits and career
advancement options.2 Based on findings from using the CLIFF Tool for residents of areas with primeage employment gaps, DWDB will work with community organizations and wraparound service
providers to design and pilot "benefits backstop" programs that address barriers to workforce transitions
related to childcare, housing, transportation, and training needs. ASCENT will engage partners in
prioritized industry sectors to implement workforce advancement solutions for high-opportunity fields.
Regional Assets and Synergies: ASCENT is a collaborative effort among economic and workforce
development agencies, nonprofits, community-based organizations, and industry leaders. The initiative
will build upon the groundwork established by the DWDB through the EDA-funded Delaware
Employment Equity Project (DEEP) Statewide Planning Grant, which has identified pervasive challenges
impeding prime-age (25-54 years) employment participation. Career transition and advancement
programming will focus on those industries targeted by the Delaware Prosperity Partnership that leverage
existing regional assets such as NIIMBL, The Innovation Space, Launcher, and the FinTech Hub.
Additional partnerships may emerge from potential grants to Delaware through the Hydrogen Hub and
NEXUS and HELICS applications submitted under the EDA Tech Hub grant opportunity.
Lead Applicant: DWDB is uniquely situated at the nexus of workforce development in Delaware. The
vision of our organization is to advance prosperity for individuals, communities, and businesses. This is
achieved through a comprehensive lens on workforce development, not just training programs. This lens
includes building a skilled pipeline of workers for businesses while addressing the needs of the individual
through wrap around supports.
